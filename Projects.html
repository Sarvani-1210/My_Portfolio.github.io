    <h2>Title:</h2>
    <p>"Three Level Password Authentication Using Python and TKinter."</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In an organizational network, when the control of resources is given to more than one user,the identity of users must be verified and then granted access to their entitlements. That can be done with the help of a password, as it has long been one of the preferred ways to validate one’s identity and relies on one’s ability to authenticate oneself by presenting the correct credential.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as the password is simply text-based, it is very easy for the attacker to get hold of a user’s password and impersonate the user and gain access to the organizational resources to which the user is entitled.
    </p>
    <p>
        So to protect the organizational resources and data from hackers and malicious software, single security authentication is not sufficient enough. Therefore, needs something for secure and userfriendly authentication schemes to overcome this problem. This paper presents a 3-level password authentication scheme to overcome the problem.The three different levels used in the 3-level password authentication scheme are text password, one-time password (OTP), and imagebased password. The main objective is to provide a high level of security to the organization’s resources or applications from hackers and secure the resources from unauthorized users.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>
        Three-level password authentication is a security mechanism that provides a high level of protection for sensitive data and systems of organizations. It involves using three levels of passwords, each with increasing levels of complexity and access privileges.The purpose of using three-level password authentication is to ensure that only authorized users can access and use critical systems and data.Each level of password provides a different level of access, and the combination of all three passwords provides the highest level of security.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first level of password is usually a simple password that is easy to remember and is used to access less sensitive data and systems. The second level of password is more complex and is used to access more sensitive data and systems. The third level of password is the most complex and is used to access the most sensitive data and systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Proposed System:</h2>
    <p>In this proposed model the user has 2 Modules,
        <ul>
        <li>Registration Module</li><li>Login Module</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="levels_page-0001.jpg" alt="" id="img2">
    <h2>Registration Module:</h2>
    <p>
        In this phase, the user first needs to register with the system or application. To register, the needs need to submit the authentication details such as user name, Password, and mobile number and select an Image for the third phase of authentication. All the details at the registration were matched with details of login to authenticate the user. If all the details are correctly matched then only the user can successfully access the data.
    </p>
    <h2>Login Module:</h2>
    <p>
        In this phase, the user needs to face three levels of authentication.
        <ol>
            <li><a href="level1.html">Level 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="level2.html">Level 2</a></li>
            <li><a href="level3.html">Level 3</a></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Results:</h2>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
        Based on the research, providing a 3-level authentication password scheme is better than a single-factor authentication because it needs to pass through the 3 levels to authenticate successfully. The main reason proposed this scheme is to enhance the security of computer systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three-level authentication system had been applied to the above system which makes it highly secure along with more user-friendly. This system will help with Man-in-the-middle attacks and Brute-force attacks on the user’s side. A three- level security system is a time-consuming approach since the user needs to enter details carefully for all three security levels and at last, the user can add any image for its final level Authentications. Therefore, this system is unsuitable for security since it takes time to fill in all three security-level details.
    </p>
    <p>
        But it will be helpful in high-security levels where the security of data is a primary concern and time complexity is secondary. The main objective of this project is to improve the security level of the systems for many survey papers where researched.It is found that a three-level authentication system helps to provide more security compared to onelevel and two-level authentication systems. Three levels are more important because the user needs to enter critical details and login with three different levels of authentication.
